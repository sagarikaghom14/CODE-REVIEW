❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){return a+b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function scope, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
*   ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments, making it inflexible and only able to work with global variables (which is bad practice).
*   ❌ Missing semicolon at the end of function definition (minor stylistic issue, but good to be consistent).

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

*   ✔ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters, making it reusable and predictable.
*   ✔ The function is self-contained and doesn't rely on global variables.
*   ✔ Added a semicolon for consistency.

Final Note:
Always define variables within the scope where they are used. Using parameters makes your functions much more versatile and less prone to errors caused by unexpected global state.
